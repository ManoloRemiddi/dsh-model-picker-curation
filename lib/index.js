// dsh-model-picker-augmented node half.
//
// The browser half (the "./client" export, lib/client.js) provides the
// searchable composer model picker and the "Model Picker Augmented" settings
// page. This node half exists so the bundle patch row (cordis.patch.yml) can
// mount the package in the web profile — the client-modules scan reads the
// `dsh.client` declaration from packages mounted in the host Loader — and it
// registers the plugin's durable settings namespace: the browser half persists
// the curated list (hidden models + pinned order) through the harness settings
// document (`model-picker-augmented` in settings.yaml), so it survives browser
// and machine restarts. Keep this file: removing it breaks the mount and the
// persistence.

import z from "schemastery";
